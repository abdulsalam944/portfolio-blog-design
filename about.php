         <p>My name is Sagnik. I&#39;m a programmer. I&#39;m very happy to live in&nbsp;a time when I get to see an outburst in rapid development of technologies everyday. My technology interest is broad. It starts from Web Development to Mobile to VR&nbsp;to Gaming to AI to Raspberry PI. Out of those, I only work on Web as a professional.&nbsp;</p>
         <p>I write blogs about programming, technology, life, culture and regarding anything that I can put my head around. I put my code on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/nickborti\">Github<\/a>.
         I tweet from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickborti\">@nickborti</a>.

         You can drop me a mail at <a href=\"mailto:nickborti@gmail.com\">nickborti@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;whenever you want.&nbsp;</p>

         <h3>How I got started</h3>

         <p>In college, it was just like spending everyday&nbsp;without having a clue about &quot;What am I doing with my life?&quot;. We were not taught what was needed to be taught to get involved in industry in the future.
         Around 2012 one of my college buddies asked me to take a summer training course on&nbsp;J2EE along with him and
         couple other guys. After attending some classes, I figured out that I had no idea what was going on in the course.
         All I could remember was some terms like JDBC and ODBC, whereas after listening to the conversations of other guys,
         it seemed that they were learning atleast to some extent probably because they had some knowledge on that tech stack
         before.</p>
         <p>At the end of the training, we were given a project to work on. Since I didn&#39;t get anything out of the training,
         I had a doubt about my contribution towards it. I figured out that nobody in my team knew HTML and CSS good enough
         to produce something that we can show proudly. That&#39;s it! I found a loophole in the overall knowledge of my team.
         That made me to learn HTML and CSS from different online free courses which I browsed through day and night! &nbsp;
         I contributed to the project and I got interested towards the web.</p>

         <h3>What made me push forward</h3>
         <p>A friend of mine asked me to create a social networking website one fine afternoon.
         I don&#39;t know what happened after that. I skipped&nbsp;college and gave my all to something that I had no idea about.
         I didn&#39;t regret not going to college since college wasn&#39;t interesting at all.
         At that time, I did not even know <strong>how to submit a form</strong>.
         I did not even know <strong>how backend talks to frontend</strong>.
         I had to learn all and in the learning and creating process, I found some answers to my questions.
         Though I couldn&#39;t complete what was intended and drifted towards something else after few months,
         but I gained my knowledge to work on Backend Technologies like PHP and MySQL which I didn&#39;t know about before.
         After that I have worked on web and have made many web applications.</p>
         <p>Currently, I work on JavaScript Stack but whenever required I switch to other languages also.
         I&nbsp;encourage people to learn about different software technologies and to follow their passions.
         Currently I stay in my home city Kolkata, India and do R&amp;D in a software company.
         Contact me if you are around. Will be happy to grab a beer!</p>
